# Dungeon Generator

## About
Many modern games use procedurally-generated dungeon maps. However, since these maps are not statically modelled but are procedurally generated, the complexity of the procedurally generated dungeon creates opportunities for clipping, texture mismatching, and collision issues, which reduces the player's immersion and aesthetics.

Our project aims to study and explore different algorithms and techniques to procedurally generate dungeons. Furthermore, we intend to add parameter configurability, placement of furniture and decoration, as well as ensuring seamlessness. Hence, the problem we hope to solve is: How might we improve the seamlessness and configurability of procedurally generated Dungeon maps?
